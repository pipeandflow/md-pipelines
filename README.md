This Repository contains snakemake workflows for Molecular Dynamics uses.  

It's aimed to serve as an example for working with snakemake.

**NOTE:** some of the pipelines may requires specific environment modules or code modificiations. As such, they are not yet fully reproducible by other groups. It's a work in progress.
